#Real Estate CSV Parser 

---
###Objective

This project is simply a series of Python scripts to parse a csv/xlsx
file for certain information. This is part of a project for a client who 
operates a real estate website. The script makes use of some RegEx searches
but mostly it is pure Python. I'm putting this code here mostly as practice
using Git and Github but also to back up these scripts should they ever
get deleted on my local repository. I suspect I will need these in the future
and will continue updating them as I do more data engineering work for this
client.
